problem: given n stones whose weights add up to 1 (all real numbers between 0-1) and given a real number in (0,1) called "weighted number". 
what is the number of subsets, call it x (<= 2^n), such that in at least x subsets, sums of the stones inside the subset is greater or equal to weighted number?
